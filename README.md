# Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-Project-and-Homework
The second problem in the pdf uses the generated bipartite graph for this project.
## Problem 2
- In part a, I come up with a nontrivial unweighted, undirected and connected bipartite graph.
- In part b, 1000 random walks are executed with a constant length, and with a biased starting distribution.
- In part c, I follow the same approach as in part b, but with a 1/4 probability of remaining at the same vertex with each step.
- In part d, we implement the same approach as in part b, except we record the final vertex after each random walk of variable length.
